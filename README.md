json-to-vcard
=============

JavaScript converter from JSON-Contacts to vCard and vCard to JSON-Contacts.


See Specification in the features/Spec directory for details.


This project is not supposed to implement the complete vCard standard. Rather I'll add features whenever they are needed. All supported features are listed with examples in the features directory.

If you find bugs or you need new features, please post a JSON / vCard pair and conversion direction in the issue tracker.
